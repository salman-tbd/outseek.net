                  When we started working with different industries, we quickly learned that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work. A solution that's perfect for a retail store might be completely wrong for a hospital. That's why we've made it a point to understand the unique challenges each industry faces.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Over the years, we've built systems for healthcare providers who need HIPAA compliance, financial institutions that process millions of transactions, manufacturers tracking production in real-time, and retailers managing inventory across multiple channels. Each project taught us something new about what works in that specific industry.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  This experience means when you work with us, you're not just getting a technology vendor. You're getting a partner who understands your business, knows your compliance requirements, and has solved similar problems before. That knowledge saves you time, reduces risk, and helps us build solutions that actually work in the real world.
